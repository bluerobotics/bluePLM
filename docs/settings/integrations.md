### Obtaining a Document Manager API Key

The SolidWorks Document Manager (DM) API key is **required** to read SolidWorks file metadata, extract thumbnails, and track references without needing a full SolidWorks installation. This is essential for server-side processing and for users who don't have SolidWorks installed.

**How to get your DM API key:**

1. **Contact your SolidWorks reseller (VAR)**
   - Your Value Added Reseller can request a Document Manager API license on your behalf
   - Provide them with your SolidWorks serial number and company information

2. **Or request directly from SolidWorks**
   - Visit the [SolidWorks Customer Portal](https://customerportal.solidworks.com)
   - Log in with your SolidWorks account
   - Navigate to **My Products** → **Request Document Manager Key**
   - Fill out the form with your application details

3. **What you'll receive**
   - A license key string (looks like: `your-company-name:swdocmgr_general-00000-00000-00000-00000-00000`)
   - This key is tied to your SolidWorks subscription

**Entering your key in BluePLM:**

1. Go to **Settings** → **Integrations** → **SolidWorks**
2. Paste your Document Manager API key in the license key field
3. Click **Save** and restart the SolidWorks service

**Important notes:**
- The DM API key is separate from your SolidWorks installation license
- Keys are typically provided at no additional cost with active SolidWorks subscriptions
- The key allows read-only access to SolidWorks file data
- Keep your key secure — treat it like a password
