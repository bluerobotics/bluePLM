# BluePLM Documentation

BluePLM is a desktop application for managing engineering files across teams. It uses Supabase as its cloud backend for authentication, file storage, and real-time sync.

## How It Works

1. **Admin** sets up a Supabase project and configures BluePLM
2. Admin generates an **Organization Code** to share with the team
3. **Team members** download BluePLM and enter the code to connect
4. Everyone signs in with Google, email, or phone
5. Connect to **Vaults** to start working with files

## First Launch

When you first open BluePLM, you'll go through:

1. **Language selection** - Choose your preferred language
2. **Usage statistics** - Opt in/out of anonymous analytics

Then you'll see the **Setup Screen** where you choose your role.

## Next Steps

- **Admins**: [Admin Setup Guide](/admin-setup) - Configure Supabase and create the organization
- **Team Members**: [User Setup Guide](/user-setup) - Join an existing organization
