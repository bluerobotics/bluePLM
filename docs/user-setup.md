# User Setup

This guide is for team members joining an existing BluePLM organization.

## What You Need

- BluePLM installed on your computer
- An **Organization Code** (from invite email or your admin)

## Step 1: Get the Organization Code

You'll receive the Organization Code in one of two ways:

### If You Received an Invite Email

Your admin sent you an invite email containing:
- The **Organization Code** (copy it from the email)
- A link to download BluePLM
- Setup instructions

Just copy the code from the email and continue to Step 2.

### If You Need the Code from Your Admin

Ask your admin for the Organization Code. It looks like:

```
PDM-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX...
```

This code contains the connection info for your organization's Supabase backend.

## Step 2: Enter the Code

1. Open BluePLM
2. Complete the language/analytics setup if this is your first launch
3. On the Setup screen, click **"I have an Organization Code"**
4. Paste the code your admin provided
5. Click **Connect**

## Step 3: Sign In

Choose how to sign in:

### Team Member
Click **Team Member** to sign in as a regular user:
- **Google** (recommended) - fastest option
- **Email** - enter email and password
- **Phone** - receive an SMS verification code

### Supplier
If you're a supplier/vendor accessing the supplier portal:
- Email or phone authentication only
- Your access is limited to supplier-specific features

## Step 4: Connect to a Vault

After signing in, you'll see the **Welcome screen** showing available vaults.

1. Click **Connect** next to a vault
2. BluePLM creates a local folder for the vault (e.g., `C:\BluePLM\vault-name`)
3. Files sync between this folder and the cloud

::: tip Vault Location
- **Windows**: `C:\BluePLM\vault-name`
- **macOS**: `~/Documents/BluePLM/vault-name`
- **Linux**: `~/BluePLM/vault-name`
:::

::: warning Windows Performance Tip
For best performance with SolidWorks and other CAD files on Windows, add your vault folder to Windows Defender exclusions. This prevents antivirus scanning from slowing down file operations.

See the [Admin Setup Guide](/admin-setup#optimize-performance-windows) for detailed instructions, or check with your IT department before making changes.

## Working Offline

Can't connect right now? Click **Work Offline** on the sign-in screen.

In offline mode you can:
- Browse and edit local files
- Changes won't sync until you're back online

## Troubleshooting

### "Invalid Organization Code"
- Make sure you copied the entire code
- Ask your admin to regenerate the code if needed

### "Sign in failed"
- Check your internet connection
- Try a different sign-in method
- Contact your admin if your account isn't set up

### Can't see any vaults
- Your admin needs to grant you vault access
- Go to Settings → Members & Teams (admin only)
