-- BluePLM Core Schema
-- =====================================================================
-- 
-- This file contains the foundational schema required by ALL BluePLM installations:
--   - Organizations
--   - Users
--   - Teams & Permissions
--   - Authentication
--   - Sessions
--   - Notifications (generic)
--   - User Preferences
--
-- DEPENDENCIES: None (this is the base layer)
--
-- IDEMPOTENT: Safe to run multiple times
--
-- After running this, install optional modules from the modules/ folder:
--   - 10-source-files.sql (files, vaults, workflows)
--   - 20-change-control.sql (ECOs, reviews, deviations)
--   - 30-supply-chain.sql (suppliers, RFQs)
--   - 40-integrations.sql (Odoo, webhooks)
--   - 60-customers.sql (Odoo customer sync, AI enrichment)
--
-- =====================================================================

-- NO EXTENSIONS ARE INSTALLED HERE, DELIBERATELY
--
-- This file used to open with
--
--   CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS "uuid-ossp";
--
-- with no SCHEMA clause, so the extension landed in whatever schema came first
-- in the caller's search_path - `public` for the postgres role. On Supabase
-- that was usually a no-op, because the platform preinstalls uuid-ossp in the
-- `extensions` schema. Where it was not preinstalled, the statement created a
-- dozen functions in public that the project can never withdraw from anon:
-- supautils runs CREATE EXTENSION for privileged extensions as supabase_admin,
-- so the functions come out owned by supabase_admin with `anon=X/supabase_admin`
-- in their ACL, and `postgres` revoking them gets "WARNING: no privileges could
-- be revoked" and no change. check_anon_reach() then reports objects reachable
-- without authentication that nobody can make unreachable. One CREATE EXTENSION
-- with no SCHEMA clause was enough to put a project permanently one step short
-- of a stamp.
--
-- Pinning it to `SCHEMA extensions` would only move the problem: that schema
-- does not exist outside Supabase, and every column default calling the
-- extension's uuid_generate_v4() would then depend on the caller's search_path
-- reaching it at CREATE TABLE time.
--
-- The dependency is not needed at all. gen_random_uuid() has been in core
-- Postgres since 13, generates the same v4 UUIDs from the server's strong
-- random source, and belongs to pg_catalog, which is on every search_path and
-- owned by a role no project can be asked to fight with. Every DEFAULT in this
-- release uses it, and migrate_uuid_defaults() at the end of this file moves
-- existing databases over so they stop depending on the extension too.
--
-- If an installation needs uuid-ossp for something else, install it yourself,
-- in the `extensions` schema, and check_anon_reach() will grade whatever it
-- creates in public as advisory rather than pretending it can be fixed.

-- ===========================================
-- SCHEMA VERSION TRACKING
-- ===========================================
-- schema_version.version is what the app reads to decide whether to show a
-- "database out of date" warning. It is therefore a claim about the whole
-- database, and the only useful property it can have is that it is never
-- higher than the truth.
--
-- It used to be written in three places that could each lie:
--
--   1. core.sql stamped the head unconditionally with ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE.
--      Re-running core.sql alone on an old database moved the number to the
--      head while every module stayed where it was.
--   2. Each module stamped the head as well, so that re-running one module -
--      the usual way a single RPC fix is applied - advanced the version.
--      Applying only 30-supply-chain.sql to a v86 database therefore reported
--      88 with module 10's v87 work absent, and the app showed no warning.
--   3. Under the documented `psql \i` path a module that errors partway
--      through still reaches its stamp at the end of the file.
--
-- The common cause is that the number is global and monotonic while the files
-- are per-module: no single number can express "30 applied, 10 not", so any
-- scheme where one file sets it is guessing about the others.
--
-- So nothing sets the version as a side effect of being run any more. The
-- version is a *result*, written only by verify_and_stamp_schema(), which
-- checks that the objects this release requires actually exist first. Modules
-- stamp nothing; core.sql seeds the row and never touches an existing one.
-- Applying a subset of the files leaves the old number in place, which is a
-- warning rather than a false all-clear. See supabase/README.md.

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS schema_version (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT 1 CHECK (id = 1), -- Only allow single row
  version INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 1,
  description TEXT,
  applied_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  applied_by TEXT
);

-- Seed only. DO NOTHING rather than DO UPDATE: on an existing database the
-- recorded version belongs to whatever was last verified, and core.sql knows
-- nothing about the modules, so it is in no position to overwrite it.
-- Version 0 on a fresh install reads as "installed but not yet verified".
INSERT INTO schema_version (id, version, description, applied_at, applied_by)
VALUES (1, 0, 'Installed but not verified - run supabase/tools/verify-schema.sql', NOW(), 'core.sql')

--             module made every requirement of that module 'skipped' rather
--             than 'missing'. A database holding core.sql alone - 18 of 76
--             tables - passed every check and was stamped 89. A required module
--             must be able to fail, which means its requirements must be probed

-- ===========================================
-- WHAT A CLOSED HOLE LEFT BEHIND
-- ===========================================
-- CLOSING A HOLE AND REVOKING WHAT IT PRODUCED
--
-- Every release up to 92 was verified against a fresh install, so nothing had
-- ever asked a release whether it cleans up after itself. It does not, and a
-- fresh install cannot show that: there is no history for the fix to fail to
-- undo. Applied over a database that had run v90 and been attacked, v92 left a
-- share link minted by a member of one organization for another organization's
-- file still answering is_valid: true to an unauthenticated caller, and
-- consume_share_link still spending downloads against it. It survives BECAUSE
-- of the fix - validate_share_link now resolves the organization from the file,
-- and the file genuinely is in that organization - and verification returned
-- stamped: true with all of it in place.
--
-- The general shape, which is worth naming because this will happen again: a
-- security fix changes what the code will do next time. It does not change what
-- the data records from what the code already did. A credential a hole minted
-- outlives the hole, and so does a disclosure the hole performed.
--
-- The place where the two should always travel together is here, in the release
-- manifest, which until now only described objects. It has a second half now:
--
--   schema_release_manifest()  what the code must BE
--   check_release_residue()    what the data must no longer CONTAIN
--
-- Both are read by verify_and_stamp_schema() and both withhold the stamp. So a
-- release that closes a hole and forgets the remediation cannot be recorded:
-- verification names the residue and refuses, on the databases that have it and
-- on no others. A fresh install has none and is unaffected.
--
-- The remediations themselves run from the module that owns the data, at the
-- end of the file, next to enforce_anon_execute_posture() - so applying the
-- schema performs them and there is no separate script to remember. They are
-- idempotent, they deactivate and redact rather than delete, and they copy
-- every row they touch into the ledger below verbatim first, so nothing an
-- auditor might want is destroyed by the act of cleaning up.

-- It used to fill every argument but p_org_id with NULL, and accept any P0001
-- or any returned {"success": false} as a refusal. Both halves of that were
-- wrong in the same direction: a function that validates some *other* argument
-- first refuses the probe, is scored gated, and is never asked the question the
-- probe exists to ask. Two functions with no authorization of any kind in them
-- were scored gated and stamped, and then read another organization's data.
--
-- So: the other arguments are filled with values a function can get past -
-- probe_literal_for_arg() below, which reads the function's own vocabulary
-- where it has one - which is what lets execution reach the gate; and a refusal
-- is only credited when it can be *attributed* to an authorization check,
-- meaning the function's own source calls one. The two tests are a conjunction
-- and each covers the other's blind spot:
--
--   a check inside `IF false THEN`  -> source has it, behaviour answers -> ungated
--   a NOT NULL violation, no gate   -> behaviour refuses, source has none -> ungated
--
-- Neither test alone would catch both, and reading the source alone is what the
-- release before last did.
--
-- AND ATTRIBUTION IS EXACTLY AS GOOD AS ITS TOKEN LIST
--
-- The conjunction is only as strong as what the source half counts. It counted
-- `auth.uid()`, which is who is asking and not whether they may, so a function
-- with no authorization whatsoever - one line, `v_actor UUID := auth.uid();` -
-- was scored gated, stamped, and read another tenant's parts over HTTP. It
-- counted `is_org_admin()` too, which is a real check about the wrong
-- organization. See c_gate_binding below for what is left and why, and for the
-- ten RPCs that had to change so that removing them cost nothing true.

-- WHY A FUNCTION IS NOT PROBED, DECIDED FROM THE ACL AND NOT FROM A LIST
--
-- check_org_gates() used to carry two hardcoded arrays of names it skipped.
-- One of them, c_trigger_only, was described as "only ever called by a
-- trigger", and it held seed_customer_categories - a SECURITY DEFINER function
-- that anyone with a login could call over PostgREST against any organization,
-- for as long as the array said not to look. The claim was about how the
-- function is *called*; what mattered was who is *allowed* to call it, and
-- nothing checked that.
--
-- So the question is asked of the database instead:
--
--   'predicate' - one of the two gates the other functions are gated BY.
--                 Probing a gate for a refusal has no failing answer, so this
--                 exemption is about the shape of the question, not the ACL.
--                 posture-checks.sql exercises both directly.
--   'withdrawn' - no PostgREST role may execute it. It cannot be handed a
--                 foreign organization id because it cannot be called at all.
--   NULL        - probe it.
--
-- 'withdrawn' is the important one: it lasts exactly as long as the ACL does.
-- Grant the function back to anon or authenticated - which is what Supabase's
-- default privileges do to every function postgres creates - and this returns
-- NULL on the next run and the probe takes over.

  -- WHAT MAKES A REFUSAL ATTRIBUTABLE
  --
  -- A call that ties the caller to the organization the function was asked
  -- about. Nothing weaker, and the list used to contain three weaker things.
  --
  -- `auth.uid()` was the worst of them. It answers "who is asking", which is a
  -- stamp and not a gate, and a function whose only recognised token was
  --
  --   DECLARE v_actor UUID := auth.uid();
  --
  -- with no authorization of any kind anywhere in it scored gated, was stamped
  -- by verify_and_stamp_schema(), and served one tenant another tenant's parts
  -- over HTTP. `current_actor_id()` is the same answer that raises when the
  -- answer is nobody: it establishes that somebody is signed in, and signing up
  -- is free. `is_org_admin()`, `user_has_permission()` and
  -- `user_has_team_permission()` are genuine authorization checks and still not
  -- these: they ask what the caller may do in their OWN organization and take
  -- no p_org_id, so an admin of one tenant passes them while naming another.
  --
  -- Removing them is only honest if the code stops depending on them, and ten
  -- RPCs did - each hand-writing `SELECT org_id INTO v FROM users WHERE id =
  -- auth.uid()` and comparing it to p_org_id. Every one was correct, and their
  -- correctness is why this list had to be wrong: the checker was widened to
  -- accommodate the convention instead of the convention being kept. They call
  -- require_org_member() or is_org_member() now, which is what
  -- check_null_unsafe_org_gates() has told people to do for two releases.
  --
  -- Named c_gate_binding rather than c_gate_evidence because the change is what
  -- counts as evidence, and a build carrying the old copy should not satisfy the
  -- manifest by accident.

-- Everything an unauthenticated caller can still reach.
--
-- Supabase's bootstrap runs ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA public GRANT ALL
-- ON FUNCTIONS TO postgres, anon, authenticated, service_role, so every function
-- created in public is born with an explicit anon grant and stays that way
-- unless something takes it away. enforce_anon_execute_posture() is what takes
-- it away; this is the check that it did, and the one that notices the next
-- function somebody adds without running it.
--
-- WHY THERE IS A severity COLUMN
--
-- The previous version returned one undifferentiated list and
-- verify_and_stamp_schema() treated every row in it as fatal. Supabase creates a
-- default-privilege entry owned by supabase_admin as well as the one owned by
-- postgres, and `postgres` is not a member of supabase_admin, so
-- `ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES FOR ROLE supabase_admin ...` raises
-- insufficient_privilege no matter who runs it from the SQL editor.
-- enforce_anon_execute_posture() warned and moved on, this function reported the
-- row, and the stamp was withheld - permanently, on a correctly installed
-- database, with all 35 manifest objects reporting ok. The advice printed
-- alongside was to run the very function that had just failed.
--
-- A check the operator cannot act on must not be able to block them. Rows are
-- 'blocking' or 'advisory', and only 'blocking' withholds the stamp. The line
-- between them is one question, asked the same way everywhere: *could the
-- caller revoke this if they wanted to?* If yes it is blocking, because it is
-- their job. If no it is advisory, because otherwise the script is demanding
-- something impossible - which is exactly what v90 did, while advising the
-- operator to run the function that had just failed to do it.
-- tools/emergency-lockdown.sql draws the same line, so the two agree about
-- what "clean" means.
--
-- WHERE THAT LINE IS DANGEROUS, AND WHAT KEEPS IT HONEST
--
-- 'advisory' is a way for a real exposure to not stop a release, so it has to
-- be narrow. Two rules hold it in place:
--
--   1. Advisory is decided by the catalogue, not by a judgement call:
--      anon_revoke_grantors() lists the roles that granted anon the privilege,
--      and the row is advisory only when the caller is a member of none of
--      them and is not a superuser. Anything the caller *can* revoke stays
--      blocking however inconvenient.
--   2. Advisory is never quiet. tools/verify-schema.sql prints advisory rows
--      above the summary and calls out the ones that are live objects rather
--      than policies, because "you cannot fix this from here" is not the same
--      sentence as "this is fine".
--
-- The original advisory case - a default-privilege row owned by supabase_admin
-- - was safe for a further reason worth keeping in mind: it describes a policy,
-- and every object the policy produces is still swept and still reported. An
-- object that is itself unrevokable has no such backstop, which is why it is
-- printed with the detail spelled out rather than folded into a count.

-- the platform and not about the text. So this asks the narrow, decidable
-- question instead: is there a permissive SELECT policy, applying to anon
-- directly or through PUBLIC, whose USING expression is the constant true? That
-- is the shape that admits anon to everything, and it is the shape somebody
-- writes by accident when they want a table readable by the sign-in screen.
--
-- A qual of `1 = 1`, or one that reduces to true through a function, is not
-- caught. Stating that is better than implying a completeness this cannot have;
-- the allowlist below is what makes the deliberate cases explicit, so anything
-- else arriving is at least visible in a diff.
--
-- Restrictive policies are ignored: they can only subtract from what a
-- permissive one grants, so one can never be the reason anon sees a row.

-- ANON HOLDS SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE AND DELETE ON EVERY TABLE IN public
--
-- Supabase's bootstrap runs ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA public GRANT ALL
-- ON TABLES TO anon, so every table this schema creates is born with all four
-- granted to the unauthenticated role. 101 of 102 hold it - schema_version is
-- the exception only because it is on the allowlist above. Nothing but
-- row-level security stands between an anonymous caller holding the publishable
-- key and every row in the database.
--
-- That is stated here, in the schema, rather than left as an observation
-- somewhere, because the question "should we revoke them?" has a measured
-- answer and the answer has a sequence to it.
--
-- WHAT WAS MEASURED, IN THE HARNESS
--
-- harness/sql/anon-table-grants-experiment.sql revokes all four from anon on
-- every relation in public except the allowlist, withdraws the default
-- privilege, and then the full suite runs against it:
--
--   * 18 of 18 attacks refused - unchanged;
--   * 12 of 12 positive controls still working - unchanged.
--
-- Nothing broke, because every path the product uses is either a SECURITY
-- DEFINER function - which executes as its owner and does not consult the
-- caller's table grants at all - or an authenticated request, which uses
-- `authenticated`, untouched by any of this.
--
-- WHY IT IS NOT IN THIS RELEASE ANYWAY
--
-- The app makes exactly two unauthenticated table requests, both SELECT on
-- organizations, and both already return nothing because that table's policies
-- admit only authenticated. Both tolerate an error. So far so safe.
--
-- The API server makes a third. api/src/infrastructure/supabase.ts,
-- checkDatabaseHealth(), does `client.from('organizations').select('id')` with
-- the bare anon key and reports the database UNHEALTHY on any error. Measured
-- over HTTP in the harness: with the grant, anon gets `200 []`; without it,
-- `401 {"code":"42501","message":"permission denied for table organizations"}`.
-- So revoking flips /health to unhealthy, and on a platform that reads that
-- endpoint - Railway, Render, Fly - the API is pulled out of rotation. That is
-- the silent breakage this kind of change is warned about, and it is silent in
-- the worst way: the schema change and the deployment that notices it are
-- weeks apart.
--
-- THE SEQUENCE, FOR WHOEVER PICKS THIS UP
--
--   1. Change checkDatabaseHealth() to something that does not depend on an
--      anon table grant - `select version()` over an RPC on
--      anon_execute_allowlist(), or the /health probe the platform already has.
--      That is an api/ change and it ships on the API's own version.
--   2. Deploy it, and confirm no other consumer of the publishable key reads a
--      table. The two in the desktop app are listed above; a new one would be
--      a new call site, and this note is what tells its author to look.
--   3. Then revoke, in the sweep at the end of each module, alongside the
--      routine posture: REVOKE ALL ON TABLE ... FROM anon for everything not on
--      anon_read_allowlist(), plus ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES ... REVOKE ALL ON
--      TABLES FROM anon so the next table is born closed. The experiment file
--      is that statement, already written.
--
-- AND WHAT IS TRUE IN THE MEANTIME
--
-- "Check instead that every table's policy provably excludes anon" is the
-- appealing alternative and it is only partly available: whether a policy
-- excludes anon is not decidable from its expression. `USING (org_id IN (SELECT
-- org_id FROM users WHERE id = auth.uid()))` excludes anon because auth.uid()
-- is NULL for it, which is a fact about the platform and not about the text.
-- What check_anon_reach() does cover is the two decidable cases: row-level
-- security switched off at all, and a permissive SELECT policy reaching anon
-- whose USING is the constant true. Both withhold the stamp. Between them they
-- catch every way a table has actually been left open here, and neither is a
-- proof of exclusion in general. Saying that plainly is worth more than a check
-- that implies a completeness it cannot have.

--
-- The shape is banned outright rather than only where it is currently
-- exploitable. A gate whose correctness depends on a second condition someone
-- may later remove is not a gate. Use is_org_member() or require_org_member().

--
-- The first version of this check was a literal regex for
-- `not in (select org_id from users`, run over plpgsql functions only. All nine
-- shipped sites happened to be spelled that way, so it found all nine and the
-- release said the shape was "banned outright". It was not: an alias, a
-- schema-qualified `public.users`, the `<> ALL (...)` form, `NOT (x IN (...))`,
-- `NOT (x = ANY (...))`, and anything written in LANGUAGE sql all walked past
-- it. Each of those is the same NULL, and each would have shipped.
--
-- What is still not covered, stated rather than implied: a membership subquery
-- against a table other than `users`, a comparison against a variable loaded
-- from users in an earlier statement (`SELECT org_id INTO v FROM users ...;
-- IF p_org_id <> v THEN`), and anything built with EXECUTE. The first two are
-- worth knowing about; check_org_gates() is what stands behind them, and the
-- convention that closes them is to call is_org_member() and never hand-write

-- Functions that check one argument and then act on another.
--
-- create_file_share_link took p_org_id and p_file_id, called
-- require_org_member(p_org_id) - which passed, because the caller really was a
-- member of the organization they named - and then inserted p_file_id without
-- ever asking which organization that file belonged to. Passing your own org id
-- with somebody else's file id minted a working share token for their file. The
-- argument that was checked was not the argument that selected the row.
--
-- Neither existing check could see it. check_org_gates() calls the function with
-- NULLs and looks for a refusal, and it got one, because require_org_member()
-- refuses an unauthenticated caller. check_anon_reach() only asks who may
-- execute, and the answer - authenticated members - was correct. The function
-- was certified by both while being wrong for the one caller that mattered.
--
-- Rule 1 below is narrow on purpose: it reports only the specific contradiction
-- of gating on p_org_id while never once using p_org_id to constrain a row. A
-- function that says `WHERE org_id = p_org_id` somewhere, or that derives the
-- organization from the entity through a require_..._access() helper, is doing
-- the binding and is left alone - including get_vault_files_delta(), whose
-- vault filter sits on a different line from its org filter but is still inside
-- the same query.
--
-- WHY THIS NO LONGER STARTS FROM p_org_id
--
-- The first version only considered functions that take a p_org_id, because
-- create_file_share_link took one. That filter was the finding restated as a
-- rule rather than the rule the finding was an instance of: a function that
-- gates on an *entity* - require_file_access(p_file_id) - and then acts on a
-- second id it never checks has exactly the same defect and no p_org_id
-- anywhere, so this check could not see it.
--
-- apply_workflow_transition was that function. It called
-- require_file_access(p_file_id), which is correct and sufficient for the file,
-- and then loaded p_transition_id with an existence test and nothing else. A
-- member of one organization applied another organization's classified
-- transition to her own file, and its workflow name, state name and transition
-- name are now in her workflow_history. It was in this release's manifest, and
-- the check written to stop this recurring could not look at it.
--
-- Dropping the p_org_id filter leaves seven security-definer functions in
-- public that take two or more row-selecting uuid ids. Six bind the second one;
-- one did not.
--
-- THE RULE, AND WHY IT IS A COUNT
--
-- Proving "argument B is constrained to the organization argument A
-- established" from source text is not something a regex can do - the binding
-- may be two statements away, through a record variable. A rule that demanded
-- proof would report functions that are correct, and a check that cannot be
-- satisfied is worse than no check: that was finding 1, a verifier withholding
-- the stamp for a condition the operator could not clear.
--
-- So the rule counts, and it errs towards passing. Every id the function looks
-- a row up by needs an organization check that is not already spoken for by a
-- different id. It cannot tell you *which* check covers which argument in the
-- general case, and it does not try; what it can tell you is that there are
-- more ids being reached through than there are checks left to cover them.
--
-- One subtraction in that arithmetic is load-bearing and was not there at
-- first. A resolver call is a binding, but it is a binding of the argument it
-- was handed. `require_file_access(p_file_id)` followed by a bare
-- `WHERE id = p_transition_id` has one binding and one unchecked id, which
-- balances on a naive count - and is exactly apply_workflow_transition. So a
-- resolver call is subtracted from the checks available before the comparison
-- is made. NC11 in the harness is that case, and it is the reason the harness
-- reintroduces each hole rather than trusting the rule to be right.

-- FUNCTIONS WHOSE ENTIRE DEFENCE IS THE ABSENCE OF AN EXECUTE GRANT
--
-- Some SECURITY DEFINER functions cannot be gated by an argument, because they
-- take no organization to check the caller against. The two extension-log
-- sweeps delete by age across every tenant at once; the three seeders run from
-- the on_organization_created trigger, before the new organization has any
-- members to be one of. For all five, not being callable is the whole of the
-- protection, and check_org_gates() cannot express that: with no p_org_id there
-- is no foreign id to substitute and no refusal to require.
--
-- So the ACL becomes the assertion. This list is small and hand-maintained on
-- purpose - it is a statement that somebody looked at each of these and
-- concluded the endpoint should not exist for a PostgREST caller, not a
-- heuristic. Adding a function here is cheap; the cost of leaving one out is
-- what release 95 nearly shipped.
--
-- Why this is separate from check_org_gates() rather than folded into it: that
-- function decides a verdict for every SECURITY DEFINER function in the schema,
-- and changing how it reaches one changes what the stamp means everywhere. This
-- asks a single closed question about five named functions and can only ever
-- add a problem for one of them.

--
-- WHY EVERY FILE MAY ASK, WHEN NO FILE MAY STAMP
--
-- Until 89 each file stamped the head version unconditionally at its end, and
-- that had to stop: the number is one global value while the files are
-- per-module, so `SELECT update_schema_version(88)` at the bottom of
-- 30-supply-chain.sql was a claim about seven files that module cannot see. It
-- recorded 88 over a database missing module 10's v87 work, and the app compared
-- 88 to its own 88 and showed no warning.
--
-- Delegating to verify_and_stamp_schema() removes the defect rather than the
-- convenience. The answer is computed from the whole release manifest and every
-- security check, so it does not depend on which file asked, and a file that
-- asks too early is simply told no. What was wrong was never that a schema file
-- did the asking; it was that being run counted as an answer.
--
-- This is deliberately quiet about failure - one line, no object list. During a
-- normal install every file but the last one gets a no, and seven paragraphs of
-- missing objects scrolling past on a correct install is how an operator learns
-- to ignore the output. tools/verify-schema.sql is the detailed report, and it
-- ends with an error rather than a notice.
--
-- It cannot raise, and that is load-bearing rather than defensive. The Supabase
-- SQL editor wraps a run in a single transaction, so an exception thrown here
-- would roll back the file that had just been applied successfully: an unstamped
-- install is a warning, a rolled-back one is an outage. verify_and_stamp_schema()

-- Withdraw EXECUTE from anon on everything in public except that allowlist.
--
-- The previous version of this did the wrong thing in two ways, and the
-- combination is why 149 functions were reachable by anon on a stock Supabase
-- project while the verification script printed an all-clear.
--
-- First, it revoked FROM PUBLIC. Supabase's bootstrap runs
--
--   ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA public
--     GRANT ALL ON FUNCTIONS TO postgres, anon, authenticated, service_role;
--
-- which *adds* to the built-in default rather than replacing it, so a new
-- function's proacl is
-- `{=X/postgres,postgres=X/postgres,anon=X/postgres,authenticated=X/postgres,service_role=X/postgres}`.
-- REVOKE ... FROM PUBLIC strips only the leading `=X/postgres`. The explicit
-- `anon=X/postgres` survives untouched and PostgREST keeps exposing the
-- function to anon. The only thing that removes it is naming the role.
--
-- Second, it asked `has_function_privilege('public', ...)` to decide whether
-- there was anything to do. On a database where the bootstrap had run, that is
-- false for a function that anon can nonetheless execute, so the loop selected
-- nothing and the function returned 0 - a clean bill of health over a fully
-- open schema.
--
-- The scope is also wider than before. It used to cover only SECURITY DEFINER
-- functions taking a p_org_id, which missed every function that reaches an
-- organization through an entity id instead - checkout_file, move_file and the
-- rest. anon has no business executing anything here, so the rule is now
-- "nothing except the allowlist" rather than an attempt to enumerate the
-- dangerous ones.
--
-- Doing this by class rather than one REVOKE per function is still deliberate:
-- these modules DROP and re-CREATE functions, which discards the ACL, so the
-- privileges are rebuilt from default on every install and the revoke has to be
-- part of the install to mean anything. core.sql and each module call this at
-- the end of their own file.
--
-- Where a function is reachable through PUBLIC as well as through the explicit
-- anon grant, both have to go. Withdrawing PUBLIC would also take the privilege
-- from any other role that only held it that way, so every such role's access
-- is first pinned down as an explicit grant. No role but anon loses anything.

  -- Postgres builds a new object's ACL in get_user_default_acl(): if there is

  -- Measured in the harness on Postgres 17, as postgres, after the loop above
  -- has removed anon from the schema-scoped row:
  --
  --   before  {=X/postgres,postgres=X/postgres,authenticated=X/postgres,service_role=X/postgres}

-- THE ANCHOR EVERY OTHER GATE IN THIS SCHEMA RESTS ON
--
-- users.org_id and users.role are what is_org_admin(), require_org_member(),
-- require_file_access() and every membership subquery below resolve against.
-- Until this release the self-update policy was USING (id = auth.uid()) with no
-- WITH CHECK, and a policy with no WITH CHECK reuses its USING expression as the
-- check - which tests the *new* row's id, not its org_id or role. One
-- PATCH /rest/v1/users?id=eq.<self> {"org_id": "<other org>", "role": "admin"}
-- returned 200 and moved a viewer into another tenant as its administrator, so
-- every gate schemas 89-94 added was answered honestly against a row the caller
-- had just rewritten. The BEFORE UPDATE trigger above (auto_set_user_org_id) is
-- a no-op stub and caught nothing.
--
-- WHY A WITH CHECK AND NOT A COLUMN GRANT
--
-- A column-level GRANT UPDATE is issued to a *role*, and both policies here
-- apply to the same role, authenticated. A grant therefore cannot tell a user
-- editing their own row from an admin editing a member's - and the admin path
-- legitimately writes role (src/lib/supabase/teams.ts:37), so granting role to
-- keep team management working hands the escalation straight back. A WITH CHECK
-- is per-policy, which is exactly the distinction that is needed: role and
-- org_id are pinned on the self policy and left alone on the admin policy.
--
-- The subqueries read the caller's row under the statement snapshot. Rows
-- written by the current command are not visible to subqueries within that same
-- command, so these observe the pre-update values and cannot be satisfied by
-- the write they are checking.
--
-- IS NOT DISTINCT FROM rather than =, because org_id is nullable: an account
-- that has signed up and not yet joined an organization has org_id NULL, and
-- `NULL = NULL` is NULL, which fails the check and would lock that account out
-- of its own last_online write. This is the same NULL-unsafety the nine
-- membership tests schema 91 corrected, on the other side of the comparison.
--
-- TO authenticated: these were the only two policies in this block without a
-- role qualifier - the three organizations and users SELECT/UPDATE policies
-- above all carry it - so they applied to PUBLIC, which includes anon. Not
-- exploitable while auth.uid() is NULL for anon, but the bootstrap grants anon
-- explicitly and schema 90 exists because a default grant nobody had named
-- turned out to be load-bearing.

-- EXAMINED AND SOUND - DO NOT WRITE A STRICTER CHECK HERE
--
-- This policy had no WITH CHECK either, and that is not a second hole. Nothing
-- in supabase/ is AS RESTRICTIVE, so both UPDATE policies on users are
-- permissive and PostgreSQL ORs them on the WITH CHECK side as well as the
-- USING side. The effective check on the new row is:
--
--   (NEW.id = auth.uid() AND role and org_id unchanged)
--   OR (NEW.org_id IN (caller's org) AND is_org_admin())
--
-- An admin moving *another* user to a foreign org fails branch 1 (the id is the
-- victim's) and branch 2 (the foreign org is not in the caller's org set), and
-- is refused. An admin moving *themselves* passes through branch 1 - which is
-- the defect the policy above now closes, not a defect in this one.
--
-- The check below is written out rather than left implicit, matching "Admins
-- can update their organization" above, which spells its check out. It restates
-- the default and is therefore semantically a no-op; it is here so that the
-- next reader does not have to reconstruct the permissive-OR argument to be
-- sure of it. Anything *stricter* breaks this policy's entire purpose: pinning
-- role here breaks updateUserRole (src/lib/supabase/teams.ts:14-44), which is
-- the one thing it exists to allow.
--
-- Two known gaps that are product decisions and not cross-tenant holes, left
-- for the owner rather than fixed here: there is no last-admin protection, so
-- an admin can demote the only other admin and strand the organization; and
-- there is no column restriction, so an admin can rewrite a member's email or
-- id and desync the row from auth.users.
--
-- Separately: addUserToOrg (teams.ts:90, insert at :121) writes a user whose org_id is
-- NULL, and `NULL IN (SELECT ...)` is NULL rather than true, so this policy
-- already refuses it. Adding a member by email over the table path is broken
-- today, independently of this release. Fixing it means a SECURITY DEFINER RPC
-- as the invite path already uses, not a looser USING clause here.

-- ONE FUNCTION WHERE THERE WERE TWO
--
-- Production carried two overloads of this name: this file's own
-- no-argument version, and a p_user_id UUID DEFAULT NULL version that
-- predates the schema.sql -> core.sql split and that no `DROP FUNCTION
-- IF EXISTS get_user_module_defaults() CASCADE` - exact on the empty
-- signature - ever reached. It survived, untouched, since.
--
-- Checking call sites decided which was stale, not which looked newer.
-- modulesSlice.ts's loadUserModuleDefaults calls the no-argument form and is
-- never invoked from the UI. teams.ts's loadImpersonatedUserContext, which
-- the admin "view as user" feature calls to read a target user's effective
-- module config, passes p_user_id - and that is the shape this schema's own
-- history shows the function was written with from the start: the original
-- took p_user_id UUID DEFAULT NULL and resolved COALESCE(p_user_id,
-- auth.uid()) precisely so one function could answer both "my own defaults"
-- and "this other user's defaults" for whoever was allowed to ask.
--
-- What it did not do, in either overload, was check that "allowed to ask" -
-- p_user_id was substituted with no membership test at all. Restored with
-- one added, using require_same_org_user the same way get_user_vault_access
-- and get_user_permissions already gate exactly this shape of question:
-- looking up somebody else's own private-scoped data.
--
-- Gated on `p_user_id IS NOT NULL`, not on `p_user_id <> auth.uid()`: an
-- unauthenticated caller has auth.uid() = NULL, and `p_user_id <> NULL`
-- evaluates to NULL rather than true, so a caller with no session at all
-- would have sailed past a check written that way. require_same_org_user
-- still returns immediately when p_user_id names the caller themselves - a
-- caller who passes their own id explicitly pays one extra membership check,
-- not a refusal.
