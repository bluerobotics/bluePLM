/**
 * Create a shareable link for a file - generates a signed URL from Supabase Storage.
 *
 * The recipient's URL is the storage URL itself, so expiry is the only property
 * BluePLM holds over it, and Storage is what enforces that. An issued link cannot
 * be recalled, capped or restricted to signed-in users: each of those would require
 * downloads to travel through a BluePLM-controlled endpoint, which is a deliberate
 * non-goal. Controls that promised any of them are gone rather than left inert.
 *
 * ## Why the audit row is written before the URL is minted
 *
 * The row in `file_share_links` is the only authorization step in this flow. Nothing here asks
 * whether the caller may share the file; the INSERT policy on that table is what answers, and it
 * is the only thing that does. So the order matters, and it used to be the wrong way round: the
 * signed URL was created first, the insert came after inside a `try`/`catch`, and the comment
 * argued that best-effort was correct *because the URL was already valid* - the defect stated as
 * its own justification. A caller the policy refuses walked away with a working seven-day public
 * download and left no trace.
 *
 * Note also what that `try`/`catch` was not doing: `supabase-js` reports a refused insert by
 * returning `{ error }`, not by throwing, so the block caught nothing and the refusal was
 * discarded by never being read rather than by being swallowed.
 *
 * Minting after the insert means a signing failure can leave an audit row for a link nobody
 * received. That is the right way round: a row recording an attempt is harmless, and it is what
 * an audit trail is for.
