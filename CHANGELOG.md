# Changelog

All notable changes to BluePLM will be documented in this file.

## [2.16.0] - 2025-12-29

### Added
- **Remove from team**: Inline button in Team Members settings to remove users from specific teams (warning color) alongside existing "Remove from organization" (error color) for clear differentiation
- **Job Titles**: Display-only labels for users (e.g., "Quality Engineer", "Project Manager")
  - Inline title selector on each user row in Members & Teams
  - Admins can click to assign any user a job title from a dropdown
  - "Create new title..." option directly in the dropdown - no separate settings page needed
  - Database tables: `job_titles`, `user_job_titles`
- **Default Permission Teams**: New organizations get Viewers/Engineers/Admins teams with pre-configured permissions
- **Delete Account**: Users can permanently delete their own account from Settings → Account → Delete Account
  - Type-name confirmation required (must type your full name to confirm)
  - Removes organization association, team memberships, vault access, and active sessions
  - Releases any file checkouts held by the user
  - Preserves activity history and file versions for audit purposes

### Changed
- **Permissions model simplified**: Removed role selection from create user dialog and user rows - all permissions now flow through team membership
- **Create User dialog**: Now includes vault access restrictions and optional invite email
  - Leave vaults unchecked for full access, or select specific vaults to restrict the new user
  - "Send invite email" option (requires API server) automatically emails the user to sign up
- **Email domain auto-matching removed**: Users no longer auto-join orgs based on email domain. Join methods:
  - Pre-created accounts (pending_org_members) - admin adds user email, they auto-join on signup
  - Organization code - user enters code to join
  - `create_default_permission_teams()` function bootstraps orgs with proper access levels
  - ALL permissions now flow through teams (simplified model)
  - Viewers: read-only access to modules
  - Engineers: create/edit access to engineering modules

### Improved
- **Network error handling**: Better resilience for unstable or lost connections
  - Automatic retry with exponential backoff (up to 3 attempts) for downloads, uploads, and get-latest operations
  - User-friendly error messages ("Unable to connect to server" instead of "Failed to fetch")

### Fixed
- **Clipboard operations**: Fixed "Write permission denied" error when copying to clipboard in packaged app
  - Created centralized clipboard utility that uses Electron's native clipboard API (more reliable than browser API)
  - Updated all 13 components to use the new utility with proper fallbacks

---

## [2.9.4] - 2025-12-17

### Fixed

- **Added auth timeout safety net**: If organization connection takes longer than 30 seconds, the app will now timeout gracefully instead of hanging forever
- **Added cancel button to connecting screen**: Users can now click "Cancel" to sign out and retry if the connection hangs

---

## [2.9.3] - 2025-12-17

### Fixed

Added database index on `user_sessions.org_id` for better query performance. Improved session sync to update all sessions unconditionally.

---

## [2.9.2] - 2025-12-17

- **Odoo integration visibility**: Allow all org members to view Odoo integration status (not just admins)

---

## [2.9.1] - 2025-12-17

### Fixed
- **Online users presence not showing other org members**: Fixed critical bug where sessions were registered with `org_id = NULL` before the organization was fully loaded. Other users in the same org couldn't see each other online. Now properly syncs session org_id with the user's organization and updates user org_id in database when matching org is found.

---

## [2.9.0] - 2025-12-17

- **SolidWorks Integration Improvements**: Enhanced stability and performance for SW metadata extraction and file operations
- **Odoo Configuration Improvements**: Streamlined Odoo integration setup with better validation and error handling

### Fixed
- **Organization settings not saving**: Added missing RLS UPDATE policy for organizations table. Admin updates to organization settings (e.g., SolidWorks DM license key) were silently blocked by Row Level Security.

---

## [2.7.2] - 2025-12-16

### Changed
- **Double-click cloud-only files**: Double-clicking a cloud-only file now downloads it first, then automatically opens it. Previously showed a toast asking the user to right-click to download.

---

## [2.7.1] - 2025-12-16

### Fixed
- **Bottom panel resize divider**: Fixed issue where dragging the horizontal resize divider between File Browser and Details Panel would accidentally drag files instead of resizing the panel. Added proper z-index, event handling, and expanded hit area to prevent file drag from taking over.

---

### Fixed

---

## [2.6.0] - 2025-12-15

### Added
- **SolidWorks Metadata Auto-Extraction**: Automatically extracts metadata from SolidWorks files during file operations
  - Extracts part number, description, revision, and custom properties from .sldprt, .sldasm, .slddrw files

  - Creates a new file version if metadata has changed

---

  - Visual banner shows when impersonation is active
  - Click banner or use Dev Tools to exit impersonation

### Fixed
- **API URL disappearing after app update**: Organization settings were being overwritten when saving individual fields. Each settings update now fetches current settings from database first before merging.
- **Checkout toast spam**: Fixed excessive toast notifications on checkout by setting `updated_by` field, so realtime subscription correctly identifies current user's actions
- **Missing spinners on First Check-In**: Individual files now show loading spinners during sync/checkout/checkin operations (previously only folders showed spinners)
