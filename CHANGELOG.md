# Changelog

All notable changes to BluePLM will be documented in this file.

## [2.20.1] - 2025-12-31

### Fixed
- **Pending users showing in main list**: Users who haven't signed in yet (still pending) now only appear in "Pending Members" section, not duplicated in the main user list

---

## [2.20.0] - 2025-12-31

### Added
- **Per-vault permissions**: Teams and individual users can now have different permission levels per vault. Set "All Vaults (Global)" for org-wide permissions, or select a specific vault for vault-scoped permissions. Example: Engineering team can have admin on Production vault but view-only on Archive vault

### Changed
- **Schema version**: Bumped to v20
- **Permission functions**: `get_user_permissions` and `user_has_permission` now accept optional `vault_id` parameter for vault-scoped checks

---

## [2.19.3] - 2025-12-31

### Fixed
- **User record not created after account deletion**: Fixed critical bug where signing in after "Delete Account" would fail to create the user record in `public.users`. The `ensure_user_org_id` RPC now creates the user record if the auth trigger failed, and applies pending team memberships

### Changed
- **Schema version**: Bumped to v19

---

## [2.19.2] - 2025-12-31

### Fixed
- **Invited users added to wrong team**: Fixed bug where users invited with specific teams (e.g., "Doris") were also incorrectly added to "New Users" team. Now only adds to default team if user has no team memberships yet

### Changed
- **Schema version**: Bumped to v18

---

## [2.19.1] - 2025-12-31

### Changed
- **Admin remove user fully deletes**: Removing a user from the organization now fully deletes them from `auth.users`, allowing clean re-invites without "user already registered" errors
- **Schema version**: Bumped to v17

---

## [2.19.0] - 2025-12-31

### Fixed
- **Multi-vault display bug on sign-in**: Fixed issue where the second vault would show the first vault's files until manually selecting each vault. Root cause was the working directory not updating when `activeVaultId` changed, and stale closure issues in the auto-connect flow
- **Invited users can't see teams/roles**: Fixed critical bug where `handle_new_user` didn't include `org_id` in the `ON CONFLICT UPDATE` clause, so returning users with pending invites never had their org assigned

### Changed
- **Schema version**: Bumped to v13

---

## [2.18.3] - 2025-12-31

### Added
- **Block user feature**: Admins can now block users from the organization. Blocked users cannot rejoin via org code and need an explicit re-invite
- **Regenerate org code**: Admins can regenerate the organization code/slug for security, invalidating all existing org codes

### Fixed
- **Invite flow 403 error**: Fixed RLS policy that queried `auth.users` directly (permission denied). Now uses `auth.jwt()` to get email from JWT token
- **Case-insensitive email matching**: All invite-related email comparisons are now case-insensitive (RLS policies, triggers, and client queries)
- **Re-invite after removal**: When removing a user from the org, their pending invite is now cleaned up properly, allowing them to be re-invited
- **API invite validation**: API now uses case-insensitive email matching and properly cleans up old invites before creating new ones

### Changed
- **Schema version**: Bumped to v12

---

## [2.18.2] - 2025-12-31

### Fixed
- **Backup scheduler not triggering**: Fixed React closure bug where scheduled backups never ran because the scheduler was checking stale config state instead of fetching fresh data from the database

---

## [2.18.1] - 2025-12-31

### Fixed
- **Non-admin inline edit buttons**: Team and workflow role badges are now non-interactive for non-admins (previously appeared clickable but saves would silently fail)

---

## [2.18.0] - 2025-12-31

### Added
- **Realtime permissions sync**: Vault access, team membership, and permission changes now sync instantly without refresh
  - When an admin changes your vault access, you see the update immediately
  - Team membership changes apply in real-time
  - Role changes (admin→engineer, etc.) reflect immediately
  - Toast notifications inform users when their access changes

### Fixed
- **Invite flow not associating organization**: Fixed RLS policy that prevented new users from seeing their pending invite (schema v8)
- **Pending membership not applying on re-login**: Fixed triggers to fire on UPDATE, not just INSERT, so users who failed initial login can retry (schema v9)
- **Ambiguous column reference in triggers**: Fixed `apply_pending_team_memberships` function variable naming conflict

### Changed
- **Schema version**: Bumped to v9

---

## [2.17.5] - 2025-12-31

### Added
- **Change Organization option**: Added "Change Organization" link on sign-in screen to clear stored config and return to setup

---

## [2.17.4] - 2025-12-31

### Changed
- **Schema version**: Bumped to v7 (was missing from v2.17.2/v2.17.3)

---

## [2.17.3] - 2025-12-31

### Added
- **Unassigned users visibility**: Users without teams now show a prominent yellow "Unassigned" badge
- **Default team warning**: Shows warning in Teams tab when no default team is set (users will have no permissions)

### Improved
- **Default team dropdown**: Clearer "Unassigned (no team permissions)" option text

---

## [2.17.2] - 2025-12-31

### Added
- **Default Team for New Users UI**: Admins can now select which team new users are added to in Settings → Team Members → Teams tab
- **Invited users without teams get default team**: Users invited without specific team assignments are now added to the default team (if configured)

### Fixed
- **Schema migration for existing orgs**: Running schema now creates default teams for existing organizations that don't have them

---

## [2.17.1] - 2025-12-31

### Fixed
- **Org code missing slug**: `generateOrgCode` now always includes the organization slug from the current org
- **Legacy org codes without slug**: Added fallback — if org code has no slug but there's only one organization in the database, automatically join it
- **Root cause of "no organization found"**: Users with non-matching email domains and no pending invite can now join via the org slug embedded in org codes

---

## [2.17.0] - 2025-12-31

### Added
- **"New Users" default team**: New organizations automatically get a "New Users" team with Engineer-level permissions
- **Org code join flow**: Users entering an org code can now sign in without a pre-created invite — they're automatically added to the org and default team
- **`join_org_by_slug` RPC**: Database function for joining an organization via org slug (from org code)
- **`default_new_user_team_id` setting**: Admins can configure which team new users (joining via org code) are auto-added to

### Fixed
- **Invited users auth flow**: `on_auth_user_created` trigger now fires on INSERT **and** UPDATE (fixes issue where `inviteUserByEmail` creates auth.users first, then user signs in)
- **Delete account now hard deletes**: `delete_user_account` actually removes records from `auth.users` and `public.users` instead of just soft-deleting
- **Pending membership role handling**: Improved logging shows exact role being assigned from pending_org_members
- **Backup RPC call**: App now calls `apply_pending_team_memberships` RPC as fallback if DB trigger doesn't fire

### Changed
- **Schema version**: Bumped to v6
- **Email domain enforcement**: `join_org_by_slug` respects email domain restrictions if configured

---

## [2.16.10] - 2025-12-30

### Fixed
- **New user auth race condition**: Added retry logic when fetching user profile (handles trigger timing)
- **Invited users not linked to org**: Now checks `pending_org_members` directly if trigger didn't run
- **Session registration fails for new users**: Added retry logic with helpful error message
- **Stuck spinners**: Users now see proper "No Organization Found" screen with helpful guidance

### Changed
- **Invite email button**: Links directly to blueplm.io/downloads instead of auth confirmation URL

---

## [2.16.9] - 2025-12-30
