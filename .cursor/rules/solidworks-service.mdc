# SolidWorks Service

## ALWAYS After Changes

1. **Close BluePLM app** if running (the service exe is locked while in use)
2. **Rebuild** the service:

```powershell
cd solidworks-service/BluePLM.SolidWorksService && dotnet build -c Release
```

Why: The Electron app loads the compiled `.exe` from `bin/Release/`. Without rebuilding and restarting, your code changes won't take effect.
