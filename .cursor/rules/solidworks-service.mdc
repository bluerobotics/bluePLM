# SolidWorks Service

## ALWAYS Rebuild After Changes

After editing any file in `solidworks-service/`, rebuild the service:

```powershell
dotnet build solidworks-service/BluePLM.SolidWorksService.sln -c Release
```

Why: The Electron app bundles the compiled `.exe` from `bin/Release`. Without rebuilding, your code changes won't take effect.
